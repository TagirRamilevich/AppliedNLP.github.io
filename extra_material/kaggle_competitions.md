In this section, we will present some past Kaggle competitions that we believe are the most valuable for gaining practical experience in NLP. The list is based on the following YouTube review:

All competitions require achieving the highest possible prediction accuracy with your model. We recommend trying to achieve the best result for each presented task independently. You can find some hints in the Discussion section. Afterward, you can explore the Code section to check out the top solutions (usually, the best solutions are at the top if sorted by the number of votes or the public leaderboard results). Often, the best solutions not only showcase excellent ways to tackle a specific problem but also teach general problem-solving logic, introduce new methods, or demonstrate innovative tools and techniques.

1. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/avito-duplicate-ads-detection">Avito Duplicate Ads Detection</a>  
Participants were tasked with identifying duplicate advertisements on the Avito platform. The dataset included text descriptions, metadata, and images. The challenge focused on using machine learning models to detect duplications accurately, with evaluation based on logarithmic loss (log-loss).

2. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs">Quora Question Pairs</a>  
This competition aimed to classify whether two given questions on Quora have the same meaning. The dataset contained pairs of questions with labels indicating whether they were duplicates. Participants explored NLP techniques, such as feature extraction and neural networks, to solve this semantic similarity task.
