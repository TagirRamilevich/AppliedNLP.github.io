title: Meetups and Conferences
---
This section is dedicated to meetups and conferences. You will learn why it’s worth attending such events, as well as get access to several recordings of successful conferences and meetups.

1.**Information on a topic important to you**: All of these meetups and conferences have agendas. You can check the list of topics and attend only the presentation that truly interests you. This way, you can listen to a useful lecture from someone who truly understands the subject.

2.**Expanding your horizons**:  It’s always useful to listen to all presentations. Even if something is not directly related to your work or area of interest, it could be a good talk that will stick with you. And any knowledge might unexpectedly come in handy in our lives.

3.**Networking**: Third on the list, but by no means less important. Both the speakers and the attendees of these talks share your interests, and they are likely to be true enthusiasts of their fields. The value of meeting new people or maintaining old connections in such a community cannot be overstated.

4.**Merch, prizes, food, and parties**: Often, such events feature thematic competitions where you can win merch or other prizes. Many meetups are held in a fairly informal manner, and there may even be a "party" segment. On many meetups, you might even get free food. In many ways, it can just be a great way to spend the evening.

In large cities with big IT companies, such events are quite common, but even if you live in a small town, you can always attend some online meetups and online conferences or watch the recordings. This way, you can even follow a conference held in another country in a different language.

Below, we’ve gathered a small collection of recordings from conferences, talks, and meetups in the public domain, which we believe are noteworthy.
