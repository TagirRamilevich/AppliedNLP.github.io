**How to Craft an Effective Resume**

A well-structured resume is as crucial as your professional skills. Even candidates with impressive experience can miss opportunities due to poorly prepared CVs. This guide will help you understand key considerations, find quality templates, and seek feedback to enhance your resume.

**Tailoring Your Resume to the Job Market**

Resume requirements vary based on your profession and the region you're applying in. For instance, in the UK, USA, and Canada, including a photo in your resume is generally discouraged, whereas in Europe and Asia, it's often recommended.  Additionally, while a one-page resume is standard, academic or research positions may require more detailed CVs.

**Formatting Essentials**

- **File Format**: Always send your resume as a PDF to maintain formatting consistency.
- **Language**: Write in the language of the company's country or in English.
- **Proofreading**: Check for typos and grammatical errors.
- **Structure**: Divide text into clear sections and use bullet points for readability.
- **Contact Information**: Include your email, LinkedIn profile, phone number, GitHub, and Telegram handle.

**Content Guidelines**

- **Conciseness**: Avoid lengthy narratives; be direct and to the point.
- **Clarity**: Steer clear of ambiguous abbreviations.
- **Achievements**: Highlight measurable outcomes using the X-Y-Z formula from Google—achieved [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]. For example, instead of "placed 2nd in a hackathon," say "secured 2nd place out of 400 teams in Alpha Bank's hackathon on predicting credit defaults using credit history data."

**Education and Experience**

- **Order**: List entries in reverse chronological order—most recent first.
- **Education**: If you have limited experience, place education before work experience. Include your institution, faculty, program, GPA (if strong), and relevant courses.
- **Experience**: Mention the project or product you worked on. For example, "At OZON, contributed to the Search team." Specify your role, briefly describe the company, and provide a link to its website.

**Technical Skills**

- **Technologies**: List programming languages, databases, libraries, and other tools relevant to the job. Recruiters often scan for specific keywords to match job requirements.
- **Languages**: Indicate proficiency levels, e.g., "English—C1 or Advanced."

**Choosing a Template**

Many online resume builders allocate excessive space to decorative elements, leaving little room for substantive content. It's advisable to create your own template in Word or use a streamlined option like the [FAANGPath Simple Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/faangpath-simple-template/npsfpdqnxmbc), commonly used for applications to major tech companies.

**Seeking Feedback**

If consulting a recruiter isn't feasible, ask colleagues in relevant forums to review your resume. While the feedback may not be professional, external perspectives can highlight areas you've overlooked. Consider visiting communities like [@sns_internships](https://t.me/sns_internships), [@analysts_hunter](https://t.me/analysts_hunter), or the chat group of the [@analyzing_analytics](https://t.me/analyzing_analytics) channel.
