In this section, we will present several easy-to-understand, readable articles from the field of NLP. The list starts with articles suitable for complete beginners, and the complexity gradually increases, but all of the articles are accessible and interesting for anyone looking to explore the field.

1. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book.pdf">Speech and Language Processing</a>
An introductory book that covers the fundamentals of computational linguistics and speech recognition. This work serves as a great starting point for those new to NLP and computational language processing.
2. <a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11030">Quora Question Pairs</a>  
This article explores the use of deep learning techniques in NLP, specifically for the task of identifying whether two questions from the Quora platform are semantically similar. A practical case study demonstrating the power of deep learning in NLP tasks.
3. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>  
This groundbreaking paper introduces the concept of the Transformer model, which has since revolutionized NLP. The paper explains how attention mechanisms alone, without recurrence, can significantly improve performance in sequence-based tasks, forming the foundation of many state-of-the-art models in NLP.
4. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space</a>  
This paper presents the concept of word embeddings, which became a key development in NLP. The work discusses how to efficiently represent words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space, enabling better semantic understanding and manipulation of language.
5. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759">Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification</a>  
This paper introduces the "bag-of-tricks" and "bag-of-words" models for text classification and demonstrates how simple classifiers like fastText can outperform more complex models. A practical and efficient approach to text classification in NLP.
6. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03130">A Structured Self-attentive Sentence Embedding</a>  
This paper takes the idea of embeddings further by introducing a self-attentive method that makes sentence embeddings more effective and structured. It helps to better capture the relationships between words in a sentence and improve overall language representation.
7. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</a>  
This paper details the training process for GPT-3, one of the largest language models to date. It introduces the concept of "few-shot learning," where a model can generalize to a wide variety of tasks with very little task-specific data.
8. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451">Reformer: The Efficient Transformer</a>  
This paper tackles the growing size and computational cost of transformers. It introduces Reformer, a model that optimizes memory usage and computation, making transformers more efficient while preserving their performance on long sequences.
9. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04558">Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation</a>  
This article presents Google's multilingual neural machine translation system, which enables zero-shot translation, allowing one model to translate between many languages simultaneously. The paper highlights the power and versatility of neural machine translation systems.
10. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150">Longformer: The Long-Document Transformer</a>  
This paper introduces the Longformer, a new type of transformer designed for processing long documents. It presents a more efficient method for handling long-range dependencies, where memory usage grows linearly rather than quadratically, making it more scalable for long-form text processing.
11. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09977">Towards a Human-like Open-Domain Chatbot</a>  
This paper describes the training of an open-domain chatbot using a vast amount of conversational data. The goal is to create a chatbot that can generate responses in dialogues that are much closer to human-like answers compared to current models.
12. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10555">ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators</a>  
This paper presents a novel method for pre-training language models, where instead of generating all possible outputs, the model learns by distinguishing between real and fake text. This approach allows the model to train on more data, resulting in a more efficient pre-training process.
