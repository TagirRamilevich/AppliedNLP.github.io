## 5. Core NLP Tasks

### 5.1 Text Classification

#### 5.1.1 Introduction to Text Classification

**Text Classification** is the process of assigning predefined categories or labels to textual data. It is one of the most common tasks in NLP and is essential for organizing and structuring information.

**Applications:**

- **Spam Detection:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of reviews or social media posts.
- **Topic Classification:** Categorizing news articles into topics like sports, politics, technology, etc.

#### 5.1.2 Sentiment Analysis

**Sentiment Analysis** is a specific type of text classification that focuses on identifying the emotional tone behind a body of text. It is widely used in marketing, customer service, and social media monitoring to understand public opinion.

**Approaches:**

- **Rule-Based Methods:** Use predefined lexicons to assign sentiment scores.
- **Machine Learning Methods:** Train classifiers using labeled datasets.
- **Deep Learning Methods:** Use neural networks for feature extraction and classification.

#### 5.1.3 Building a Basic Text Classification Model

We will build a simple sentiment analysis model using a machine learning approach.

**Dataset:**

- We'll use the **Movie Review** dataset from NLTK, which contains positive and negative movie reviews.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
2. **Feature Extraction using TF-IDF**
3. **Model Training with Naive Bayes Classifier**
4. **Model Evaluation**

**Example Code:**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews
import random
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Download the movie_reviews corpus
nltk.download('movie_reviews')

# Load the reviews and labels
documents = [(list(movie_reviews.words(fileid)), category)
             for category in movie_reviews.categories()
             for fileid in movie_reviews.fileids(category)]

# Shuffle the documents
random.shuffle(documents)

# Prepare the data
reviews = [" ".join(words) for words, category in documents]
labels = [category for words, category in documents]

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(reviews, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature extraction using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=2000)
X_train_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_features = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Model training using Naive Bayes
classifier = MultinomialNB()
classifier.fit(X_train_features, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test_features)

# Evaluation
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

**Output:** 

Accuracy: 0.81  
Classification Report:
| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| neg   | 0.80      | 0.83   | 0.81     | 198     |
| pos   | 0.83      | 0.79   | 0.81     | 202     |
| accuracy | -      | -      | 0.81     | 400     |
| macro avg | 0.81  | 0.81   | 0.81     | 400     |
| weighted avg | 0.81 | 0.81 | 0.81     | 400     |

**Note:** The accuracy may vary each time you run the code due to random shuffling.

# Load the pre-trained model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')  

# Sample text
text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion. Tim Cook said in a conference in San Francisco."

# Process the text
doc = nlp(text)

# Print entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

### 5.3 Text Generation

#### 5.3.1 Basics of Language Models

**Language Models** are statistical models that calculate the probability of a sequence of words. They are fundamental for tasks like text generation, speech recognition, and machine translation.

**N-gram Models:**

- An **N-gram** is a contiguous sequence of N items from a given text.
  - **Unigram:** Single words.
  - **Bigram:** Sequences of two words.
  - **Trigram:** Sequences of three words.

**Markov Assumption:**

- The probability of a word depends only on the previous N-1 words.

**Formula:**

- For a trigram model: \( P(w_n | w_{n-2}, w_{n-1}) \)

#### 5.3.2 Generating Text Using a Simple N-gram Model

We will build a basic bigram model to generate text.

**Example Code:**

```python
import nltk
from nltk.util import ngrams
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
import random
import nltk.data

# Load sample text (e.g., Gutenberg corpus)
nltk.download('gutenberg')
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg

# Choose a text
text = gutenberg.raw('melville-moby_dick.txt')

# Tokenize sentences
sent_detector = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')
sentences = sent_detector.tokenize(text)

# Tokenize words and create bigrams
model = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: 0))

for sentence in sentences:
    words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence.lower())
    for w1, w2 in ngrams(words, 2):
        model[w1][w2] += 1

# Convert counts to probabilities
for w1 in model:
    total_count = float(sum(model[w1].values()))
    for w2 in model[w1]:
        model[w1][w2] /= total_count

# Generate text
def generate_text(start_word, length=50):
    text = [start_word]
    for _ in range(length):
        w1 = text[-1]
        if w1 in model:
            choices = list(model[w1].keys())
            probs = list(model[w1].values())
            next_word = random.choices(choices, probs)[0]
            text.append(next_word)
        else:
            break
    return ' '.join(text)

# Generate a text starting with 'whale'
generated_text = generate_text('whale')
print(generated_text)
```

**Output:**

`whale . but it is not , and the whale 's spout ? '' '' i have seen him . '' '' and i am not a whale , and the whale 's spout ? '' '' i have seen him .`

**Note:** The generated text may not be coherent due to the simplicity of the model.

2. **Build N-gram Models:**
    - Experiment with different values of N (e.g., unigram, bigram, trigram).
    - Implement smoothing techniques if necessary (e.g., Laplace smoothing).

3. **Generate Text:**
    - Generate sentences or paragraphs starting with a chosen word or sequence.
    - Compare the coherence of text generated with different N-gram sizes.

4. **Analyze Results:**
    - How does increasing N affect the quality of the generated text?
    - Discuss the limitations of N-gram models.

**Hints:**

### 5.4 Machine Translation

#### 5.4.1 Key Approaches to Machine Translation

Machine Translation (MT) involves automatically translating text from one language to another.

**Approaches:**

1. **Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT):**
    - Uses linguistic rules and dictionaries.
    - Relies on morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis.
    - **Advantages:** Explainable translations.
    - **Limitations:** Requires extensive manual work to create rules.

2. **Statistical Machine Translation (SMT):**
    - Uses statistical models derived from bilingual text corpora.
    - **Phrase-Based SMT:** Translates sequences of words (phrases).
    - **Advantages:** Learns from data, no need for handcrafted rules.
    - **Limitations:** May produce grammatically incorrect translations.

3. **Neural Machine Translation (NMT):**
    - Uses deep neural networks to model the translation process.
    - **Sequence-to-Sequence Models:** Encoder-decoder architectures with attention mechanisms.
    - **Advantages:** Improved fluency and handling of long sentences.
    - **Limitations:** Requires large amounts of data and computational resources.

#### 5.4.2 Translating Text Using Available Libraries

We will use the `transformers` library by Hugging Face to perform machine translation using a pre-trained model.

**Example Code:**

```python
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

# Choose model for English to French translation
model_name = 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr'
tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Text to translate
text = "Hello, how are you?"

# Tokenize text
tokens = tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch([text], return_tensors='pt')

# Perform translation and decode
translated = model.generate(**tokens)
translated_text = tokenizer.decode(translated[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Original Text:", text)
print("Translated Text:", translated_text)
```

**Output:**

```python
Original Text: Hello, how are you?
Translated Text: Bonjour, comment Ã§a va ?
```

    - Prepare your text and perform translation.

4. **Experiment:**

    - Translate different sentences.
    - Try both directions (e.g., English to German and German to English).
    - Evaluate the quality of the translations.

5. **Discuss:**

    - How does the translation quality compare to online translators?
    - What limitations did you observe?

**Hints:**

- Make sure to use the correct model name for the language pair.
- For better results, use models trained on high-resource language pairs.
