## 1.1. What Will You Learn?

This course is designed to:

- Introduce you to the fundamental concepts of NLP.
- Help you understand how text is processed and analyzed by machines.
- Provide hands-on experience with common NLP tools and techniques.
- Prepare you for advanced courses in computational linguistics, machine learning, and related disciplines.

---

## 1.2. Who Is This Course For?

This course is ideal for:

- Undergraduate students in computational linguistics or related fields.
- Beginners who are curious about how computers understand and process human language.
- Those looking to develop basic technical skills in Python and NLP.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with simple data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.).
- No prior knowledge of NLP is required.

## 1.3. How Is the Course Structured?

The course is divided into **7 chapters**, each building on the last:

1. **Introduction to NLP** – What is NLP, and why is it important?
2. **Working with Text Data** – Handling and preprocessing text for analysis.
3. **Representing Text** – From traditional methods to modern embeddings.
4. **Core NLP Tasks** – Applications like classification, information extraction, and more.
5. **Machine Learning Basics for NLP** – Applying ML techniques to text.
6. **Practical Aspects** – Working with libraries and pre-trained models.
7. **Final Project** – Solve a real-world NLP problem and build a portfolio project.

Each chapter includes:

- **Theoretical materials** explaining the concepts.
- **Interactive exercises** to reinforce learning.
- **Code examples** for hands-on practice.
