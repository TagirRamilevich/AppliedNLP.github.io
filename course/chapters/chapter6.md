## 6. Basics of Machine Learning for NLP

### 6.1 Overview of Machine Learning

#### 6.1.1 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In ML, algorithms build models based on sample data (training data) to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data where the correct output is known.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in data without predefined labels.
- **Features:** The input variables used to make predictions.
- **Labels (Targets):** The output variable that the model is trying to predict.

#### 6.1.2 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Gather data relevant to the problem.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
3. **Feature Extraction:** Transform raw data into features suitable for modeling (e.g., text to numerical vectors).
4. **Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets:**
    - **Training Set:** Used to train the model.
    - **Testing Set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
5. **Model Selection and Training:** Choose an appropriate algorithm and train the model.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters to improve performance.
8. **Deployment:** Implement the model in a real-world setting.

#### 6.1.3 Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets

Splitting your dataset is essential to evaluate how well your model generalizes to new, unseen data.

- **Common Ratios:**
    - **70/30 Split:** 70% training data, 30% testing data.
    - **80/20 Split:** 80% training data, 20% testing data.
- **Stratified Sampling:** Ensures that the proportion of classes in the splits reflects the original dataset.

**Example in Python:**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assume X is your feature matrix and y is the target vector
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)
```

#### 6.1.4 Evaluation Metrics

Evaluating the performance of your model is crucial. Different metrics provide insights into various aspects of model performance.

**Common Metrics:**

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions over total predictions.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions over all positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of true positive predictions over all actual positives.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model.

**When to Use Which Metric:**

- **Accuracy:** When classes are balanced and all errors are equally costly.
- **Precision and Recall:** When dealing with imbalanced classes or when false positives/negatives have different costs.
- **F1-Score:** When you need a balance between precision and recall.

**Example in Python:**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Predictions and true labels
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')  # For multiclass
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1-Score:", f1)
```

### 6.2 Applying Machine Learning to NLP

In NLP, machine learning algorithms are used to build models that can understand and interpret human language. Text data needs to be converted into numerical features before applying ML algorithms.

#### 6.2.1 Common Machine Learning Algorithms for NLP

**1. Logistic Regression**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks.
- **Usage:** Predicts the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
- **Advantages:**
    - Simple to implement.
    - Outputs probabilities.
- **Limitations:**
    - Assumes linear relationship between features and log odds of the outcome.

**2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression.
- **Usage:** Finds the optimal hyperplane that separates classes.
- **Advantages:**
    - Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
    - Works well with clear margin of separation.
- **Limitations:**
    - Not suitable for large datasets due to high computational cost.

**3. Decision Trees**

- **Type:** Supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression.
- **Usage:** Splits data into branches to make predictions.
- **Advantages:**
    - Easy to interpret.
    - Handles both numerical and categorical data.
- **Limitations:**
    - Prone to overfitting.

**4. Random Forests**

- **Type:** Ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees.
- **Usage:** Improves predictive accuracy and controls overfitting.
- **Advantages:**
    - Handles large datasets efficiently.
    - Reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
- **Limitations:**
    - Less interpretable than single decision trees.

#### 6.2.2 Applying Algorithms to NLP Tasks

**Feature Extraction:**

Before applying ML algorithms, text data must be transformed into numerical features.

- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Represents text as word count vectors.
- **TF-IDF:** Adjusts word counts based on their frequency in the corpus.
- **Word Embeddings:** Represents words in dense vector space (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

**Example Workflow:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Clean and preprocess text (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
2. **Feature Extraction:**
    - Convert text data into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF.
3. **Model Training:**
    - Choose an ML algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression).
    - Train the model on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Predict on the test data.
    - Evaluate using appropriate metrics.

**Example Code:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import nltk
import string
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset (e.g., SMS Spam Collection Dataset)
# Assuming 'data.csv' has columns 'label' and 'message'
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Data preprocessing
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove punctuation
    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    # Tokenization
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    # Remove stopwords
    stopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stopwords]
    # Lemmatization
    lemmatizer = nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

df['clean_text'] = df['message'].apply(preprocess_text)

# Feature extraction
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['clean_text'])
y = df['label']

# Splitting data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Model training
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues',
            xticklabels=['Not Spam', 'Spam'],
            yticklabels=['Not Spam', 'Spam'])
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

**Note:** Replace `'data.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset. The confusion matrix visualization requires the `seaborn` library.
