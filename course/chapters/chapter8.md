## Project Options

You are invited to choose one of the following project tasks. Select the one that aligns with your interests and where you feel you can showcase your strengths.

### 8.1 Classifying Reviews (Positive/Negative)

**Objective:**

Build a sentiment analysis model to classify text reviews as positive or negative.

**Requirements:**

- **Dataset Selection:**
  - Use a dataset containing text reviews with sentiment labels (e.g., IMDb Movie Reviews, Amazon Product Reviews, Yelp Reviews).
  - Ensure the dataset is sufficiently large to train and evaluate your model effectively.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Clean and preprocess the text data (tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, etc.).
  - Address any class imbalance if present (e.g., using resampling techniques).
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Experiment with different text representation methods (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
  - Justify your choice of feature extraction technique.
- **Model Development:**
  - Try multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
  - Optionally, explore deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT).
- **Evaluation:**
  - Use appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate your model.
  - Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.
- **Analysis:**
  - Interpret your results and discuss any challenges faced.
  - Include an error analysis to identify common misclassifications.
- **Documentation:**
  - Prepare a detailed report explaining your approach, findings, and insights.
  - Include code snippets, visualizations, and examples.

### 8.2 Generating Headlines for Texts

**Objective:**

Develop a model that can generate coherent and relevant headlines for given news articles or blog posts.

**Requirements:**

- **Dataset Selection:**
  - Use a dataset containing articles and their corresponding headlines (e.g., CNN/DailyMail dataset, Gigaword dataset).
  - Ensure the dataset is appropriate for the task and has sufficient examples.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Clean the text data, handling issues like HTML tags, special characters, and irrelevant content.
  - Tokenize the text and headlines appropriately.
- **Model Development:**
  - Implement a sequence-to-sequence model for text summarization.
  - Options include:
    - Encoder-Decoder models with attention mechanisms.
    - Pre-trained models like T5, BART, or GPT-2 fine-tuned on your dataset.
  - Justify your choice of model architecture.
- **Training:**
  - Train your model on the prepared dataset.
  - Monitor for overfitting and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Use evaluation metrics suitable for text generation tasks (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU scores).
  - Provide qualitative analysis by presenting example headlines generated by your model.
- **Analysis:**
  - Discuss the performance of your model.
  - Highlight strengths and limitations.
  - Suggest possible improvements.
- **Documentation:**
  - Prepare a comprehensive report detailing your methodology, results, and reflections.
  - Include code examples, generated headlines, and evaluation results.

### 8.3 Extracting Entities from a Dataset

**Objective:**

Create a system that can extract named entities from text and categorize them appropriately.

**Requirements:**

- **Dataset Selection:**
  - Use a dataset suitable for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks (e.g., CoNLL-2003, OntoNotes).
  - Alternatively, collect your own dataset and annotate it for entities.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Ensure the text is properly formatted for NER (e.g., tokenized and tagged).
  - Handle any discrepancies or inconsistencies in annotations.
- **Model Development:**
  - Implement an NER model.
  - Options include:
    - Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
    - Neural network models like BiLSTM-CRF.
    - Pre-trained transformers like BERT fine-tuned for NER.
- **Training:**
  - Train your model using appropriate methods.
  - Address any class imbalance or rare entity types.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Evaluate your model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each entity type.
  - Use a confusion matrix to visualize misclassifications.
- **Analysis:**
  - Provide insights into the model's performance.
  - Discuss any challenges in entity recognition and classification.
  - Propose methods for improving the model.
- **Documentation:**
  - Compile a detailed report explaining your project workflow, findings, and insights.
  - Include annotated examples, code snippets, and evaluation metrics.
