            <h2>1. Introduction to NLP</h2>

            <h3>1.1 What is NLP?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling 
                computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. At its core, NLP bridges the gap between human communication 
                and machine understanding.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Applications of NLP:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Text Classification:</strong> Categorizing emails as spam or not spam, classifying product reviews, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Translation:</strong> Translating text between languages (e.g., Google Translate).</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Determining whether a review, tweet, or comment is positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:</strong> Enabling AI systems like Siri or Alexa to understand and respond to user queries.</li>
                <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Generating concise summaries of long texts or documents.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition and Generation:</strong> Converting speech to text and vice versa.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Why Is NLP Important?</h3>
            <p>
                Language is one of the most natural ways humans express ideas. Computers can process vast amounts of textual data far faster than humans, but they need the ability to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Extract meaningful information.</li>
                <li>Respond intelligently to user inputs.</li>
                <li>Automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks (e.g., sorting emails, generating reports).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                With the exponential growth of unstructured data (e.g., social media posts, emails, articles), NLP is a vital tool for businesses, researchers, and developers.
            </p>

            <h3>1.3 A Brief History of NLP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1950s-60s: The Early Days</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First NLP systems: Focused on rule-based translation and pattern matching.</li>
                        <li>Example: The first attempts at machine translation during the Cold War.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>1970s-80s: Statistical NLP</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shift to <strong>statistical methods</strong>, leveraging probability and data for tasks like speech recognition.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>1990s-2000s: Machine Learning Revolution</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rise of supervised machine learning models for text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.</li>
                        <li>Growth of annotated datasets for training NLP systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>2010s-Present: Deep Learning and Transformers</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduction of neural network models like <strong>Word2Vec</strong> and <strong>GloVe</strong> for word embeddings.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Transformer architecture</strong> (e.g., BERT, GPT) revolutionized NLP by enabling contextual understanding of text.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.4 Key Challenges in NLP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ambiguity in Language:</strong> Words and phrases can have multiple meanings depending on context.</li>
                <li><strong>Variability:</strong> Different ways of saying the same thing (e.g., "Hi," "Hello," "Hey").</li>
                <li><strong>Languages and Dialects:</strong> NLP must adapt to hundreds of languages, regional dialects, and cultural nuances.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Scarcity:</strong> Many languages lack sufficient annotated datasets for training models.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.5 NLP Workflow</h3>
            <p>NLP involves several key steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Text Acquisition:</strong> Collecting raw textual data (e.g., tweets, articles, transcripts).</li>
                <li><strong>Text Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaning and preparing text for analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Converting raw text into numerical data (e.g., word embeddings).</li>
                <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Using machine learning or deep learning models to solve a specific NLP task.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assessing the performance of the NLP model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
            </ol>
